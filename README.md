In the “Website Name” field, enter the name of your site or online store that you want customers to see when they check out.

In the “Lightning Address” field, enter the Lightning address to which your Bitcoin Lightning transactions should be forwarded.

If you don’t have a Lightning address yet, set up a Lightning wallet that will provide you with a Lightning address.
